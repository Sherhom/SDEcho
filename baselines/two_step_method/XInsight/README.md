# Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Download BLIP from https://github.com/mauro-idsia/blip and JDK 11;
2. Place these files in `lib` folder according to the specification in `src/BLIP.py`;

# Run a query

## Query Spec

example query JSON file:

```json
{
   "fp": {
      "cols": [],
      "vals": []
   },
   "dp": {
      "col": "X",
      "vals": [1, 0]
   },
   "measure": {
      "col": "Z",
      "func": "sum"
   },
   "prior_cols": ["Y"]
}
```

fields:
- `fp`: The `fp` field in the JSON file stands for Fixed Predicate. This field is composed of two subfields:
  - `cols`: the list of column names in the predicate;
  - `vals`: the list of values in the predicate.
- `dp`: The `dp` field in the JSON file stands for Diff Predicate.
  - `col`: the column name of the Diff Predicate;
  - `vals`: two values to be compared.
- `measure`: The `measure` field in the JSON file stands for the measure of the Diff Query
  - `col`: the (numerical) column name of the measure
  - `func`: the aggregation function of the column (currently support `avg` and `sum`).
- `prior_cols` (optional): The list of columns that will be searched over by XPlainer. If not provided, use XLearner to identify columns with causal semantics.

## Run XInsight

```
python run.py --data /path/to/datafile --query /path/to/queryfile --use_xlearner
```
