# SDEcho: Efficient Explanation of Aggregated Sequence Difference 

**Note:** This project is currently being updated. Please check back later for the latest version.

We introduced a novel framework for explanation searching, SDEcho, which addresses the challenge of explaining aggregated sequence differences. SDEcho employs pruning techniques from three perspectives – pattern, order, and dimension – to ensure concise and accurate explanations while considering the characteristics of each pruning algorithm for hybrid optimization. 

## Directory Layout

- `baselines/` - contains all the baselines mentioned in the paper.

- `benchmark/` - contains .

- `data/` - contains the formated data for example.

- `src/` - contains all the files necessary to the implementation of SDEcho.
